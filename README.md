# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This project to an investment calculator application. It will take user input for inital investment amount, monthly deposites into account, annual interest amount
  and number of years the user wishes to calculate to show how much money will be earned over the period of time. It will display both year end totals for each year with 
  monthly deposits and without monthly deposites. At the end the program will ask the user if they would like to calcualte again with different numbers. User has the option
  to quit at this time.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  
  I found that the calculation portion of the program as well as the way it is displayed was well done. The output looked clean, and the 
  calculations were accurate.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  
  Firstly, for the benifit of the user I may have wanted to add some color to the different ouputs the user sees. Secondly, the ending loop that askes the user
  whether they want to continue or not could have been bit clearer on what to do. Lastly, seperating the protion of code that does the calculations would make 
  this more modular, that portion could be used in other progams later.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
  The hardest portion for me was getting the display to show up the way I wanted it to. I used a lot of online reading resources, i referred back to ZYBooks to 
  see if there was any information on format. Ultimatly I found a lot of help from forums as well as YouTube. Asking questions is always a great way to find answers.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  
  The most important thing i learned from this project was seperating my programs into their how .h and .cpp files. This makes
  everything much more modular as well as much easier to debug. Instead of sifting through tons of lines of code I often found myself looking at the 
  file where the dubbugger directed me to.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  Again, having everything seperated into their own files made maintanence really easy. The propper use of white spaces also makes the code easy to read. As mentioned before
  having the calculation portion of the code in its own file would make it much more adaptable but as it is most of the displays would be used in other programs.
