# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project to an investment calculator application. It will take user input for initial investment amount, monthly deposits into account, annual interest amount and number of years the user wishes to calculate to show how much money will be earned over the period. It will display both yearend totals for each year with monthly deposits and without monthly deposits. At the end the program will ask the user if they would like to calculate again with different numbers. User has the option to quit at this time.

What did you do particularly well?

I found that the calculation portion of the program as well as the way it is displayed was well done. The output looked clean, and the calculations were accurate.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Firstly, for the benefit of the user I may have wanted to add some color to the different outputs the user sees. Secondly, the ending loop that askes the user whether they want to continue or not could have been bit clearer on what to do. Lastly, separating the portion of code that does the calculations would make this more modular, that portion could be used in other programs later.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The hardest portion for me was getting the display to show up the way I wanted it to. I used a lot of online reading resources, I referred to ZYBooks to see if there was any information on format. Ultimately, I found a lot of help from forums as well as YouTube. Asking questions is always a great way to find answers.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The most important thing I learned from this project was separating my programs into their how .h and .cpp files. This makes everything much more modular as well as much easier to debug. Instead of sifting through tons of lines of code I often found myself looking at the file where the debugger directed me to.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Again, having everything separated into their own files made maintenance easy. The proper use of white spaces also makes the code easy to read. As mentioned before having the calculation portion of the code in its own file would make it much more adaptable but as it is most of the displays would be used in other programs.
